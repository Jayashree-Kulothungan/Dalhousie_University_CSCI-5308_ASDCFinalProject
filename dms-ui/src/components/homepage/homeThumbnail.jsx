            <b>Dalhousie Multifaith Services</b> offers an open door to all
            Dalhousie and King's students, staff, and faculty â€” no matter what
            their faith, philosophy, or doubt may be. We support the spiritual
            wellness of students and staff and the creation of safe space on
            campus. We do this by providing private counseling and immediate
            crisis response; promoting opportunities for inter-faith dialogue
            and spiritual development; working cooperatively with partners on
            and off campus; offering programs and events designed to develop
            respect and understanding between and among people of diverse
            spiritual and religious backgrounds.
